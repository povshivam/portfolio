          <h2>Democritus</h2>
          <div class="date">(460-370 B.C.)</div>
          <p>This famous philosopher challenged the idea of matter. He believed matter is made up of tiny objects not able to be created, divided, or destroyed; Democritus called this atomos, later originating the English word atom. He proposed that various types of matter consisted of correlating atoms, as well as stating that only empty space is between the atoms.

          <h2>Aristotle</h2>
          <div class="date">(384-322 B.C.)</div>
          <p>Challenging Democritus’ propositions, he believed all matter was made up of only four elements: fire, water, air, and earth. Aristotle availed his own ideas from his influential and popular personality.

          <h2>Robert Boyle</h2>
          <div class="date">(1627-1691)</div>
          <p>This British scientist was the first to describe the property, stating how the pressure and volume of a gas include a negative correlation. His law, Boyle's law, can be demonstrated while on an airplane, when the surrounding air pressure decreases while the pressure in your ears remains the same. The formula V2 = P1V1/P2 displays the relation between both variables.

          <h2>John Dalton</h2>
          <div class="date">(1766-1844)</div>
          <p>The philosophy of atoms was revised by this English schoolteacher by combining the work of previous scientists and his own experimentations. He constructed the atomic theory, greatly supporting Democritus’ ideas from over 2,000 years ago backed up by research.

          <h2>Dimitri Mendeleev</h2>
          <div class="date">(1834-1907)</div>
          <p>With more than 60 previously discovered, this Russian chemist studied both the physical and chemical properties of elements. He organized them by atomic mass and noticed the repeating nature of the element's properties. Mendeleev arranged them into rows using atomic mass, and columns through their properties. Melting point, boiling point, and reactivity all followed a periodic pattern in his list. As there were large gaps between some elements, he predicted new elements would be discovered with similar properties later on; his prediction turned out to be true. The scientist also acknowledged the table had its flaws, by placing certain elements out of their atomic mass order to accommodate for their similar properties.

          <h2>J.J. Thompson</h2>
          <div class="date">(1856-1940)</div>
          <p>Soon after the findings of John Dalton, this English scientist made a cathode tube ray, a glass tube with electrodes, pieces of metal, attached inside the tube; the electrodes would be powered through some wire and a battery, making green colored rays across the ends of the tube. Through further experimentation of these cathode rays, Thompson proposed they consisted of smaller, negatively charged particles, even positive charge and negatively charged electrons mixed into a sphere.

          <h2>Ernest Rutherford</h2>
          <div class="date">(1871-1937)</div>
          <p>He was a student of J.J. Thompson, and later had students of his own. These students conducted the gold foil experiment of blasting alpha particles onto a piece of gold foil. They could determine the spot of light created by those particles called electrons. This led to Thompson’s atomic model, where an atom was a combination of using a screen surrounding them. As expected, some alpha particles traveled straight ahead, while other particles bounced to the side, or even straight back. This revealed that the particles must have hit something positively charged and dense inside the nucleus. Rutherford came to the conclusion that atoms are made up of mostly empty space; he also deduced the name nucleus. Through additional research, he discovered the positively charged particles as protons.

          <h2>Niels Bohr</h2>
          <div class="date">(1885-1962)</div>
          <p>Another student of Rutherford, Bohr studied atoms for elements such as hydrogen, and his experiments led to the Bohr Model. This consisted of electrons moving in energy levels, or circular orbits, around the nucleus. The farther the electrons are from the nucleus, the more energy they have. When they return to their lower level, specific light is emitted, such as when elements are heated up. Bohr reasoned his model to be accurate for any number of electrons, however, it was later researched how energy orbits are not circular.

          <div class="date">(1891-1974)</div>
          <p>A colleague of Rutherford, Chadwick researched more into the structure of atoms. He discovered that neutrons are another particle located in the nucleus. Slowly, the current atomic model was starting to take shape.
